# nen-core
Nyteshade Enterprises NodeJS - Core Library

## Introduction

`nen-core` is designed to be a toolbox of features that I like to have available
to me when working with NodeJS. In places where distribution size is far more 
constrained, individual modules will be cherry picked. Where size is less of 
an issue, the `nen-core` library itself will be chosen.

## History and Name

Nyteshade Enterprises is a business/org moniker i use for a lot of my code, 
including projects like (ne-schemata)[https://github.com/nyteshade/ne-schemata]
and (ne-types)[https://github.com/nyteshade/ne-types]. The prefix, `nen` in 
this case refers to Nyteshade Enterprises NodeJS and this library is targeted 
at that environment. The particular `NodeJS` callout here is to differentiate 
it from other libraries such as `neo-core` which is an Objective-C library or
`nej-core` which is a Java library, and so on.

## Features

At its initial offering, `nen-core` is made up of several different packages 
and some loose leaf offerings of its own.

### Packages

 - weighted-randoms
 - ne-types
 - deepMerge (non NE library)
